# What it Does:

Although not meant to be a replacement for professional help, Admin provides a way for addicts to learn ways to overcome their addiction problem, practice recovery methods, and have all of their thoughts collected into one compact application.

Addiction recovery resources are readily available on the internet. Admin, however, neatly organizes all the resources into a single easy-to-use application.

Admin is meant to be enjoyable, giving the user something to look forward to along their recovering process. Some main features currently planned include a counter, a panic button meant for encouragement and to provide methods to defeat the urge, a journal, and an advice/resource panel for further research. All of this would be combined to form a gamified system, with levels and a rewards system, to keep the user motivated and see how “far” they are in their recovery journey.

# Motivation:

Addictions are a widespread problem that everyone is vulnerable to and many people suffer from. Some addicts want to quit but do not know how to or have the proper resources. This project is meant to provide an entertaining yet serious resource for addicts to start recovering.

# Who:

Admin is meant for recovering addicts and people who want to get rid of a bad habit. The application will fulfill the “want” of the user who wishes to start their path towards recovery.

# Similar Applications/Competitors:

Currently, no known application matches this project exactly. The resources that the application will provide are freely available, such as counters, journaling software, and panic buttons, but they lack the organization and gamification Admin will provide.

Some applications gamify self-help, such as Habitica, which is an RPG-styled gamification of a to-do list and healthy habit building, but it focuses on a different topic and targets a different niche.

# User-Types:

There will only be 2 users, the consumer and an administrator. The consumer will be using the program. The administrator will add new content and features. There is no need for moderation because there is no cooperation aspect. It is also assumed that the user wants to recover and will utilize the resources provided; if they try to cheat the leveling/gamification system, they are just wasting their time.

# User-Stories: 10/10 deadline

# Customer Side / App construction / Technical 
Design what the web app should look like.
Implement the front end design using HTML/CSS/ React and javaScript
Implement Authentication.
Implement a counter that keeps track of the length of abstinence and day since the last relapse. Should be able to reset the counter
Implement a database to save the progress, to continue to see progress (ie. counter does not reset after closing app, etc. )
Implement Journaling feature to allow users to write, edit and read their journals. 
Implement a Panic button which displays immediate advice, if feeling the urge to relapse, as well as be presented with research material to further recovery. 
Develop the API.
Gamification : Level up and Badges. 
Refactor, if necessary, such that the workflow and the user interface is organized, easy to use, and visually appealing.

# Administrative/ Non-technical / Research 
Research recovery techniques 
Map out how the panic button should work and what should be presented to the user when the panic button is hit.
Check to see if we can see the program as how a user would see it to make sure the change I made was to my liking and the change worked successfully and as expected.
